LMFAO. Yes this is the source code of Poncentran.
The malware source is exactly like this. The malware is programmed in batch where the file executes multiple executable files which are compiled GDI effects. The author does not know how to assemble all gdi effects because he is a skidder(a person who doesn't know the programming language and its basic knowledge, but copies others' code and claims it as their code). I will try to actually make a working executable out of this someday when I have time (by writing a program in C that does the same as the batch file does, but it will not have dependency on other files manually since it will extract the files into temp folder).
